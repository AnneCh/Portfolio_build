- I keep working on understanding why my images are not showing.
- tried moving all images and the component into the same folder : same result
- imported as `import MusicZero from "./music1.jpg"` and then `src={MusicZero}` :same result
- I changed the name of an image and removed the number : same result

I'm trying to insert a table of images, and no matter what path I put, the images don't siplay, whether I import them or I type to exact path or relative path. Very frustrating.

the `styleOverrides` from MUI is not working, my styles are not being applied.
Investigating the matter, day 2.

- Actually, it works for some things (like a button) but not for others (the toolbar)

- So, the Home button and Buttons of the main area of the NavBar (dev, entrepreneur etc) are affected by the changes, but the Toggle Buttons aren't.
  Yet, when I create a new category called MuiToggleButton or MuiButtonBase (selectors found from inspecting the elements), changes don't work.

- managed to adjust the display of elements within the navbar by changing the width of the `MuiButton` in `styleOverrides`
