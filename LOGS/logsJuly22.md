I kept away from building my portfolio for a few days in order to focus on building a NFT project with someone who contacted me.

I'll be spending a few hours and try to move forward.
The two tasks that I give myself are

- implementing the night/day toggle
- re-build the page on what I also spend my time doing

I need to figure out why the themes are not being displayed.

=> found it, in the V5 version, theming needs to import CssBaseline. Now my purplish theme is applied.

On to creating a toggle light/dark mode

Mindmapping my project helped me figure out the weaknesses and what still needs to be done.

My next objective is understanding theming and implementing both night/day themes adapted from a few sources, mostly d-cide.me

I've followed the docs and tutorials on how to create and import a customized theme.
Yet I can't make it to display the theme I've created

This would seem to be the next step : https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/dark-mode/
but I first need to figure out how to apply one theme and really make it work.

I've tried updating MUI, deleting node_modules, deleting mui and reinstalling it, my theme still does not appear. There's just no reason for it not to, and yet...
