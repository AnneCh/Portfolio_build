Uuuuuf, I really dislike taking breaks from things that I am learning, it always takes a while to get back en route.

<Break needed for family and health reasons>

I have to get back to programming easy (not allowed to sit down in a chair for too long), so I'll be dividing my computer time between personal health research, React projects to keep learning the ropes, improving this CV once in a while, and the NFT MarsKetplace as a third option.
