19th august

I've spent a few hours with my hands on a React tutorial from Jan 2022, Free Code Camp edition, to get the basics that I have not covered by only following quick front-end tutorials.
Proves again what life tries to teach me at every corner : I can't IQ my way through every problem, I need to master the basics and have a thorough understanding of what needs to be done and how to get it done before even starting to do anything.

So I'm roughly 2h30 through an 11h tutorial that will get me through different projects, + 6 solo projects. I'm already struggling with the first one! :D

I'm back at my portfolio today once more to try to figure out this navbar issue between links vs how to get those individual links per item per page. Mapping through the correct links with their correspondent translation endpoint is what is causing me an issue

-> Maybe I could link the position of the page in the array to the corresponding page link, instead of mapping the page NAME to the page link? ...

I've tried following several examples for the navbar;
I've removed the grid and currently trying to figure out how to have a responsive navbar (with burger for xs displays) that correctly sends the viewer to the page correctly translated

- right now I'm having an issue mapping through the list of pages with correct link, and displaying them in the bar.

still working on styling, focusing on the navbar.
trying to understand how to pass an array of links that have translations into the navbar with the map. function
================

10 august

adding a few texts/translations in the studies part

=> I would love to be able to create a chronological arrow with dates and a short sum-up so people who don't want to take the time to read can just read the headlines...

Today I'll focus on learning about the sx property and refresh the list of parameters that can be passed into the sx{}
=> goal still to stylize the navbar, especially the buttons inside

=> I understant what sx{{}} does, it allows to get the theme's parameters and select them.
I've tried doing it by passing in the theme's parameters, I can't get the backgorund of the cards to change color, same for changing the size of the navbar... I must be missing some knowledge that I will look into next time.
