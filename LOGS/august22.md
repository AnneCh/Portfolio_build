adding a few texts/translations in the studies part

=> I would love to be able to create a chronological arrow with dates and a short sum-up so people who don't want to take the time to read can just read the headlines...

==================

06 august

Today I'll focus on learning about the sx property and refresh the list of parameters that can be passed into the sx{}
=> goal still to stylize the navbar, especially the buttons inside

=> I understant what sx{{}} does, it allows to get the theme's parameters and select them.
I've tried doing it by passing in the theme's parameters, I can't get the backgorund of the cards to change color, same for changing the size of the navbar... I must be missing some knowledge that I will look into next time.
