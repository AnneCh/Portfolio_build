I've tried following several examples for the navbar;
I've removed the grid and currently trying to figure out how to have a responsive navbar (with burger for xs displays) that correctly sends the viewer to the page correctly translated

- right now I'm having an issue mapping through the list of pages with correct link, and displaying them in the bar.

still working on styling, focusing on the navbar.
trying to understand how to pass an array of links that have translations into the navbar with the map. function
================

10 august

adding a few texts/translations in the studies part

=> I would love to be able to create a chronological arrow with dates and a short sum-up so people who don't want to take the time to read can just read the headlines...

==================

Today I'll focus on learning about the sx property and refresh the list of parameters that can be passed into the sx{}
=> goal still to stylize the navbar, especially the buttons inside

=> I understant what sx{{}} does, it allows to get the theme's parameters and select them.
I've tried doing it by passing in the theme's parameters, I can't get the backgorund of the cards to change color, same for changing the size of the navbar... I must be missing some knowledge that I will look into next time.
