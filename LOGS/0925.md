I figured out what was breaking the code, the identificator for the link in the template was incorrect. Now everyuthing is displaying, but I'll comment the new code out, as I need to update the data in the `data` file

- added most projects with an interface realised so far
  => still need to figure out what to display for those without one = only the githun picture? their logo maybe ?
