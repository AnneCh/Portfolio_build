        "p1":"I started discovering an attraction for systems after learning sound engineering through my company. Coding had been on my mind for a while, I had been following tutorials and certifications through FreeCodeCamp and The Odin Project, but it was just toe-dipping and never serious.",
        "p2":"As I gained maturity and experience in my endeavors, the Covid Time started and I lost 95% of my income. As weeks went by and more restrictive measures went enforced, my team and I  put everything on the table and decided that it was time for a change. I went back on that old idea of coding, and started doing basic google searches about what languages to start with, what kinds of jobs I could be getting, what were the basics to cover and which kinds of specialties are there for me to choose from. ",
        "p3":"I was in the middle of it when we had a one-time opportunity to leave Cambodia. We quickly had to make decisions about where, when, how. My husband and I left on 13th April 2021. On 14th, Phnom Penh, where we had been living since late 2016, had fully closed, nobody was allowed outside or under very strict criteria. On the 16th,  my husband had a stroke (from which he almost fully recovered). After finalizing our settling down in Serbia, I finally got the opportunity to focus full time on coding."

        "history":"In february 2017, I met my husband, musician recently expatriated to Cambodia. He had come with hundreds of kilos of sound system and instruments which he had been buying over the years. In June 2017, I had reached the end of my contract with the NGO I had to come to Cambodia to work for, and for a couple of months, I followed him in his concerts.",
        "start":"I started by taking pictures during shows, and got a few contracts thanks to them, which kick-started my decision to work as an independent.",
        "then":"I was mostly focusing on photography, until one day, after a concert my husband was playing at, I was talking to a musician who was interested in using my husband’s microphones for a couple of gigs. Mu husband agreed that I’d use his equipment as long as I’d learn how to use it, which I eagerly agreed to. I decided to talk to more musicians, and quickly find out that there was a demand for music equipment in Phnom Penh. A couple of months into this small business, I decided to expand my rental offer by learning sound technique.",
        "sound":"I followed a team of two sound technicians through different events in Phnom Penh, until they left me handle a weekly gig by myself. My husband also shared his experience with me and taught me. Through these teachings and experience, I became a much appreciated sound technician, and provided quality equipment and services, alone or as part of a team."

        "p2":"Then, as I was gathering data and getting to understand the lay of the land, I caught myself thinking that there may be hopes that this could be an alternative I was looking for. If we were to build proper decentralized systems, we may get closer to a globally fairer place when it comes to human interactions.",
