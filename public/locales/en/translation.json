    "p1": "I started discovering an attraction for systems after learning sound engineering through my company. Coding had been on my mind for a while, I had been following tutorials and certifications through FreeCodeCamp and The Odin Project, but it was just toe-dipping and never serious.",
    "p2": "As I gained maturity and experience in my endeavors, the Covid Time started and I lost 95% of my income. As weeks went by and more restrictive measures went enforced, my team and I  put everything on the table and decided that it was time for a change. I went back on that old idea of coding, and started doing basic google searches about what languages to start with, what kinds of jobs I could be getting, what were the basics to cover and which kinds of specialties are there for me to choose from. ",
    "p3": "I was in the middle of it when we had a one-time opportunity to leave Cambodia. We quickly had to make decisions about where, when, how. My husband and I left on 13th April 2021. On 14th, Phnom Penh, where we had been living since late 2016, had fully closed, nobody was allowed outside or under very strict criteria. On the 16th,  my husband had a stroke (from which he almost fully recovered). After finalizing our settling down in Serbia, I finally got the opportunity to focus full time on coding.",
    "goals_title": "Tools for Goals",
    "goals": "Over the years, I’ve noticed that the best way for me to ever become excellent at something, is for me first to get a good understanding of the pool of things that both are related to the thing studied. This teaches me about its environments, behaviors, it may also allow me to start detecting recurring patterns and weaknesses, maybe also identify guiding principles, if they are not known already.",
    "goal1": "I found that to be the best way to maximize my understanding of the specificity to be learned and experimented with the thing to be mastered. ",
    "goal2": "So I decided to apply a similar approach to blockchain technologies.",
    "list1": "I started by making a list of things that seemed necessary to get an understanding of. This list would obviously evolve as learned.",
    "list2": "=> Is there a specific lexicon? => Understand it",
    "list3": "=> What types of interactions can happen on blockchains, and how the later work.",
    "list4": "=> Exchanges happen through smart contracts => I decided to learn Solidity, which is also what I want to aim at mastering",
    "list5": "=> Actions between the blockchain and its users happen through scripts => I went for JavaScript, with in mind to learn Python as well in the future",
    "list6": "=> Interfaces are rendered through HTML and CSS, or a framework inspired by them and seem to be staples to have in one’s arsenal, so I added those languages to my list.",
    "list7": "=> This choice then mutated into learning ReactJS, for which the basics I have acquired in HTML, CSS and JavaScript are essential.",
    "list8": "=>But all those programs can’t operate without machines. Getting a basic understanding of out tools and how they evolve, as well as networks in general seem to me to be essential too.",
    "list9": "Through the continuous study of those first languages and first delve into a totally new environment, my original list evolved. As I gained a deeper understanding of the systems, I started understanding the guiding principles behind reliable systems, as well as how engineers think and create programming languages.",
    "list10": "=> I wanted to know more on security and systems’ vulnerabilities, and started a learning path on Try Hack Me.",
    "list11": "=> I thought it would also be a good thing to know how to participate to the decentralization of Ethereum’s network by running my own node. I chose to go with Nethermind and deepen my understanding of Ethereum.",
    "list12": "After completing several tutorials {{{include list}}}, I finally arrived at the place where I needed to start coding my own dApp.",
    "list13": "I chose to go for Decentralized Finance, as I am, as many other human beings, aiming at financial freedom for my family, and firmly believe that passive incomes are one of the best ways to obtain it.",
    "list14": "I started coding to build a trading robot based on flashloan and arbitrage principles; but I quickly understood that I had bitten on more that I could chew.",
    "list15": "At the end of June 2022, another newbie like me contacted me, wanting to build a project with me as he thought my flashloan/arbitrage project was interesting and wanted to expand his portfolio, and mine with it. After talking about it, we decided to build a platform (testnet only) that would sell a few NFTs, inspired by a tutorial from Patrick Collins for FreeCodeCamp.",
    "list16": "At the same time, I am working on this digitial Curriculum Vitae to put in the reps in ReactJS.",
    "update": "August2022",
    "list17": "I share my time learning while working on the partnered NFT project, this CV’s creation, JavaScript classes on Udemy, reading through the docs of the tool and dependencies used, Try Hack Me, as well as brain workouts to develop my ability to solve problems and think outside the box."

    "history": "In february 2017, I met my husband, musician recently expatriated to Cambodia. He had come with hundreds of kilos of sound system and instruments which he had been buying over the years. In June 2017, I had reached the end of my contract with the NGO I had to come to Cambodia to work for, and for a couple of months, I followed him in his concerts.",
    "start": "I started by taking pictures during shows, and got a few contracts thanks to them, which kick-started my decision to work as an independent.",
    "then": "I was mostly focusing on photography, until one day, after a concert my husband was playing at, I was talking to a musician who was interested in using my husband’s microphones for a couple of gigs. Mu husband agreed that I’d use his equipment as long as I’d learn how to use it, which I eagerly agreed to. I decided to talk to more musicians, and quickly find out that there was a demand for music equipment in Phnom Penh. A couple of months into this small business, I decided to expand my rental offer by learning sound technique.",
    "sound": "I followed a team of two sound technicians through different events in Phnom Penh, until they left me handle a weekly gig by myself. My husband also shared his experience with me and taught me. Through these teachings and experience, I became a much appreciated sound technician, and provided quality equipment and services, alone or as part of a team.",
    "invest": "I reinvested most of my earnings in new equipment, most of it being shipped from Europe, and quickly increased my ability to provide sound systems, I was collaborating with other sound providers on bigger events, and kept learning on site.",
    "DJ": "As I got more sensitive and aware of sounds and musics, I started learning how to be a Disk Jockey  and did a few shows, the most recent one being at the 2021 Exit Festival, in Novi Sad, the first European festival to resume post-madness. Now I mostly focus on other domains and keep DJing for fun. Yet I keep increasing my musical knowledge to bridge the gaps I have with professionals who have worked in the industry for years, in the hopes of being a performing musicians one day.",
    "kevin": "Outside of the experience I gained from learning sound engineering and running my own multi-services company, I also was my husband’s agent. We also trained a DJ and sound technician, who progressively turned into our co-founder and accountant. Thanks to his own skills, we added copy-writing to the list of services we offer (English only).",
    "presence": "All my business in Cambodia was done through real-life networking, I really didn’t have to advertise much, so you won’t find a website or properly maintained social media accounts. I posted pictures and videos on our facebook page with the aim of sharing them with the musicians and venues, more than to promote our work.",
    "moving": "Moving to Serbia in the middle of covid had us wait 1 year and 2 months for our equipment to arrive. At the moment of writing these words, we still have to disinfect and test every single piece of electronic and instruments, give them some TLC. So we haven’t been working as much since we moved. I am focusing on coding while opening our network to local musicians, so that my husband progressively gets back on playing on a regular basis.",
    "skills": "What have I learned from this experience?",
    "skill1": "Renting sound equipment, I owed it to myself, at some point, to start learning about electricity, how to control those electrical signals to produce the best sound, what affects quality of sounds etc.",
    "skill2": "I also had to understand my surroundings better, for example, how are those two glass walls around the stage going to affect the speakers’ sound reflection?",
    "skill3": "I developed a better reading of people’s facial expressions and analysis of their potential needs; not being able to always hear an artist’s request on stage, I had to both be able to understand his gestures/facial expressions, and quickly try to identify the potential request, according to what I could hear, but also what he, as the <insert here type of musician> of the band, could be requesting. A drummer may need more bass and lead voice/guitar, a singer usually request more of their own voice, etc. I got much better at anticipating requests and learned to be a proper filter/interface between the expectations of the venue, the artists’ needs and the crowd’s rightful right for quality."

I excelled in foreign languages, and wanted to pursue in this direction without really knowing whether to become a teacher, or a get into translation/interpretation, or something to do with international commerce. So I looked at the options that would allow me to keep going with a relatively broad base of knowledge, to give myself more time to think. After I got my high-school diploma, I got into the Université Catholique de l’Ouest for a 5 years series of diploma.",
    "hs2": "Most of the public universities around my hometown offered traditional Language licenses, with one leading language, a second language with much less hours spent on, and sometimes a third language.",
    "hs3": "When I found that in Angers, about 2h30 drive from where I was from, I could get a License with two languages with almost equal time of study and an optional 3rd language, I was quick to make the calculations and figure out how to afford for this private university. L’Université Catholique de l’Ouest is part of a private religious colleges’ network of 5 campuses, and I was able to integrate “La Catho d’Angers” in September 2009.",

    "lic2": "Most of the classes we had aimed at furthering our understanding of linguistic structures in specific domains (classical literature, technical translations, English/Spanish-speaking media studies) in both Spanish and English. Our classes were usually given in the target language, with a few classes in French when needed. Everything was set to immerse us as much as possible into the language we were studying. But the cherry on top the cake was that I would be able to spend 6 months in a foreign country for a semester during our last year.",
    "lic3": "I managed to go exactly where I wanted to go, to Buenos Aires, Argentina. I shared my time between going to la Pontificia Universidad Catolica to attend classes (Argentinian history, marketing, in depth languages classes) that I validated at the end of the semester, and exploring the country, getting to know how Argentinian do things different than us Frenchies, between maté and tango classes.",
