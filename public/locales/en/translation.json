        "p1":"I started discovering an attraction for systems after learning sound engineering through my company. Coding had been on my mind for a while, I had been following tutorials and certifications through FreeCodeCamp and The Odin Project, but it was just toe-dipping and never serious.",
        "p2":"As I gained maturity and experience in my endeavors, the Covid Time started and I lost 95% of my income. As weeks went by and more restrictive measures went enforced, my team and I  put everything on the table and decided that it was time for a change. I went back on that old idea of coding, and started doing basic google searches about what languages to start with, what kinds of jobs I could be getting, what were the basics to cover and which kinds of specialties are there for me to choose from. ",
        "p3":"I was in the middle of it when we had a one-time opportunity to leave Cambodia. We quickly had to make decisions about where, when, how. My husband and I left on 13th April 2021. On 14th, Phnom Penh, where we had been living since late 2016, had fully closed, nobody was allowed outside or under very strict criteria. On the 16th,  my husband had a stroke (from which he almost fully recovered). After finalizing our settling down in Serbia, I finally got the opportunity to focus full time on coding."

If we were to build proper decentralized systems, we may get closer to a globally fairer place when it comes to human interactions.",
