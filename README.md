About my portfolio

# _What I want_

- Simple, user-friendly yet packed with relevant information for anyone wondering if to hire me or not

- With EN/FR versions, and the use of tools that allow blind people to listen to the code => the use of JSX seems to be the move for the latter point

- Offers an insight on how I think, how I deconstruct a problem and try to find solutions, rather than how much work I've done

- A proper balance of experiences, what are the values that I follow and principles that I try to apply, how do I work in a team

- It being pleasing to look at and user-friendly

# Structure

- HomePage

  1. One or two sentences that let the visitor choose between two portfolios: The Developper, or Multimedia (from start ups work to MBM)
  2. Access to a page of articles that describe my core principles
  3. Quick Contact link

- A. The Developper

  1. Short on why I chose this area of work
  2. Selection of projects and languages
  3. Selection of tutorials, mentors, resources (?)
  <!-- 3.1 Short Selection of projects? Portfolio-like -->
  4. Short, Medium, Long term projects + Things I want to learn
  5. Links to GitHub, StackOverflow, StackExchange(needed?), LinkedIn

---

- B. Multimedia

  1. What have I done since my degree (short bckgd on what my studies were, include links for more information)
  2. Creation of Mindbridge Media => how it unfolded and where it is now
     Page includes internal links to a page that basically sums up how the covid situation made me select different options for my life.
     Page includes links to MindBridge Media YT and FB pages.

C. A contact page

The visitor can access external links and send me an email

# _How_

I have chosen the support of React Js to build my portfolio because it's a popular framework used by defi apps developers, even if it may not be what I want to use on the long term, there's a high chance that an employer or client want their project on React.
Use of the basic react boilerplate available thru react-create-app

I will use the help of external modules like Material UI for the visual aspect of the components.

I will use the JSX syntax as it seems to be the best way for my app to be as responsive and user-friendly as possible.

From react :

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
