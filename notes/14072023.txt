I've realized that I accidently deleted the main branch where my entire online CV was hosted.... I'm gutted.

So now, no choice but to work on this project that I had for a long time, which was to finally create some legitimacy to the business I started in 2017.
Giving birth to a webpage for MindBridgeMedia.

I decided to approach it through the human lens that unites our team. We are coworkers, but started as friends. Making money out of skills that we could combine together was a result of years of talking and trying things out.
I started by renting out Jim's equipment while Kevin was still teaching English. Then, while I learned the basics of sound engineering and got my first gigs, Kevin started learning sound engineering too, so he could second me if needed.
Jim was already a performer, percussionist and MC, so we worked on gigs together.

I could use some kind of drawing animation, integrated to the "About" page, which would recreate the parcours of our company and why we offer the services that we do.
After a bit of research, it looks like making an animation will be complex or costly, so I may have to settle for a short video of a miro board, which I have started doing in order to get my thoughts in order as well.

I have to:
- integrate a burger menu (drawer?)
- replace the pictures for us
- work on the miro board to create an animation that will sum up our journey until now
